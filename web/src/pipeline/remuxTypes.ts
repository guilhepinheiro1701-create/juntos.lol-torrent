/**
 * The shape of a preparo, with nothing behind it.
 *
 * These declarations sit apart from remuxJob so the page can name a job
 * without loading one. remuxJob reaches mediabunny and its WASM decoders
 * through clientMedia and mediaInput, and a single value import of
 * `sourceSize` from the upload path was enough to weld that whole engine —
 * over a megabyte of it — into the chunk the browser parses before it can
 * draw anything. Everything here is data and arithmetic; the types it borrows
 * are type-only, which no bundler follows.
