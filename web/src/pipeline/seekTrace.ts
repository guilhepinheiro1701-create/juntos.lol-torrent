/**
 * Where the time of a cold seek goes.
 *
 * A seek passes through a dozen hands — the reads aborted, the old
 * conversion canceled, the keyframe found, the first segment muxed, put,
 * published, seen, buffered, shown — and until now none of them left a
 * timestamp. One trace per seek, marks named for the hand, all relative to
 * the moment the seek was issued; closed into a single log line a person or
 * a rig can read.
 *
 * No clock but the monotonic one, no network, no storage: the cost of a mark
 * is a map write.
