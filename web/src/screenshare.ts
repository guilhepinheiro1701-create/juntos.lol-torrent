/**
 * Screen sharing over MoQ. A publisher's browser encodes the picked surface
 * with WebCodecs and publishes it to a Cloudflare relay; every viewer
 * subscribes to that publisher's path and decodes it onto a canvas. The relay
 * does the fan-out, so the VPS carries no media and holds no session: it only
 * hands out the relay URL with the token a member's role allows, plus the
 * broadcast base only this room knows.
 *
 * Several members can share at once, one broadcast path each, so the room's
 * list of live screens — not the relay — is what tells a viewer which paths
 * exist. The relay keeps no history and announces nothing, so a subscription
 * made before its publisher is up is dead on arrival: viewers subscribe when
 * the room says a screen is live, and try again while they see no frames.
