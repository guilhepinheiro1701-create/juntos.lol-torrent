//! Filling the file behind the readers.
//!
//! The window keeps the swarm on what a reader is about to need. Once that
//! is all here and the reader has gone quiet — the remux is paused on a full
//! buffer, or nobody has seeked in a while — the peers have nothing left to
//! do, and every byte they could bring in now is a byte the next cold seek
//! does not wait for. So, disk allowing, the selection widens to the whole
//! file. The stream priority still puts the reader's window first; the rest
//! is only asked for when the window is entirely in flight.
//!
//! What a fill brought in is not thrown away when it stops. The host's own
//! background remux moves the reader around the file for minutes, and
//! releasing on every move would discard exactly what it is about to read.
//! The reservation stays at the file's size — `Holding` — until another
//! torrent needs the room, and only then is it given back.
